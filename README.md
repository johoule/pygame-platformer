## Ideas for student projects

### Easy

- Name your game.
- Change the dimensions of the game window.
- Find your own custom artwork for blocks.
- Find your own custom artwork for the hero.
- Find your own custom artwork for enemies.
- Find your own fonts.
- Find your own sound effects.
- Find your own theme music.
- Customize the background layer for a level.
- Customize the scenery layer for a level.
- Create a custom splash screen that does more than just show the name of the game.
- Improve the display_message function so that the text is in a box making it easier to read against the background.
- Change point value for coins.
- Make power-ups give points to the player.
- Display hearts/max rather than just hearts.
- Update the display_stats function so that it shows the name of the current level.
- Add a victory sound that plays when the game is won.

### Medium

- Design a complex standard level. Your level should be at least 60 blocks long.
- Incorporate different kinds of levels (normal, space level, underwater, etc.) into the game. Alter the game physics for different level types.
- Create a game with at least 4 levels total. Levels should be significantly different in layout and each should be at least 60 block long.
- Let the 'S' key toggle sound on and off. Show a little speaker/mute icon to indicate the current state of sound.
- Let the 'M' key toggle music on and off. Show a little note icon (crossed out or uncrossed) to indicate the current state of music.
- Create your own custom artwork. http://www.piskelapp.com/ is a good site for this.
- Create invincibility (star) power-up. (The optional arguments on the play_sound function can help you match an invincibility sound length to the invincibility period.)
- Add a falling image to your character animation.
- Increase the max hearts a player can have when some milestone is achieved.
- Add prizes other than coins and give them a point value.
- Track coins separately from the score. (They can still be worth points.) Give an extra life when a number of coins is earned. Reset the coin count after a life is given.
- Invent your own power-up which lasts a limited amount of time or until the player hits an enemy.
- Invent a "power-up" which has a negative consequence on a player other than reducing hearts or lives.
- Display lives with a character icon x number of lives.
- Put gaps in the blocks that run along the bottom of the level. Then make a player die when they fall through the bottom of the world. You'll need to make sure enemies that fall through are also removed from the game. Pygame's sprite.kill() function will be useful for this.
- Make a credits screen for when the player wins the game.
- Add a 'Pause' stage to the game which is activated when the player presses 'P' (or a button on the joystick). All movement and time should stop during a pause stage. Pressing 'P' again should resume. Be sure to show a message indicating the game is paused.
- Give points for getting the flag at the end of the level. Do so in a way that landing higher on the flagpole earns more points.
- Use a modifier key that makes you run faster while the key is held.
- Create cover art for your game. Save it as a PNG file. Print it in color and I'll post it in the room.

### Hard

- Create a game with at least 8 levels total. Levels should be significantly different in layout and each should be at least 60 block long.
- Change the game so that it uses the XBox controller instead of the keyboard. (https://github.com/joncoop/pygame-xbox360controller)
- Kill enemies when you land on them. You'll need to check which direction you hit the enemy from in process enemies. Award different point values for different enemy types.
- Make the game save high scores to a text file in a data folder.
- Create some other kind of custom enemy with unique behavior.
- Display actual hearts to show health. Show empty hearts when health is not full.
- Show time on the stats layer. Give a time bonus for completing a level. Have the hero die if the level is not completed in a set amount of time.
- Animate a background element such as clouds or flickering torches. (This is probably best accomplished by creating another layer that scrolls along with the background or scenery layer rather than trying to blit directly on one of those layers.)
- Add secret parts of the level that utilize vertical scrolling.
- Add more states to the Character/Hero animation. (Climbing, skidding, falling, etc.)


### Very hard
- Add ladders to the game. If a player is on a ladder, don't apply gravity. Assign vy by player input instead. Also disable jumping while on a ladder. You should use animated climbing images too.
- Put switches in the game that open and close areas of a level.
- Create a Chest object with a boolean attribute locked set to True when it is initialized. Then create a Key object. If the player intersects a locked chest with a key, then locked should be set to False and the image should be updated. Spawn a prize that the player can acquire in the grid location directly above the chest when it is unlocked. Be sure to take away the players key when the character respawns after dying or at the start of a new level.
- Give your player a gun. Let your player kill enemies by shooting them. You'll need to create Bullet objects which spawn at the hero's gun and travel in the direction the hero is facing. Bullets shouldn't travel indefinitely. Limit the number of ticks a bullet will exist before it calls the kill() function on itself. Enemies can be given a process_bullets function. (You might need to make the shooter/hero a bullet parameter so that when the bullet hits an enemy, points can be awarded.)
- Make a sign you can read or a character that 'speaks'. Display a message when the hero intersects the sign or speaking character while holding the up arrow. Don't use the default display_message function. Put a function in the Sign/SpeakingCharacter class that makes a popup that looks like text on a sign or perhaps a speech bubble.

## Grading

Each small phase of the game we've built in class starting with the starter-template will count as a minor assessment. (You'll get a 100% for each unless I suspect that you're not keeping up. In that case, I'll check up on you individually.)

Then, you can use the finished game.py file to create a full version of the game. Points will be awarded as follows:

- Easy features: 5 points each
- Medium features: 10 points each
- Hard features: 15 points each
- Very Hard features: 20 points each

This project will count as two major assessments. When you reach 100 points, you can show me your work to get credit for the first assessment. Then continue adding more features to earn points toward your second major assessment. There are probably 500 points available, so you should have plenty of options for earning points, either by choosing to complete many easy features or fewer difficult features.

You may work in groups of 2 or 3 if you wish. However, groups of two will have their scores multiplied by 2/3. This means 150 points are required for full credit. Groups of 3 will have scores divided by 2 which means 200 points are required for each assessment.


## Final Exam (Seniors)

- Create a website for your game using GitHub Pages. You do not need to write any HTML/CSS. Simply choose a GitHub pages theme that fits your game. Your website should include...
    - A direct download link and a link to the GitHub repository. (10 points)
    - Instructions for running the game which include stating the necessary version of Python and Pygame to install. (10 points)
    - Basic game play instructions. Be sure to describe the goal of the game, controls, and basic information about enemies and powerups. (20 points)
    - Include at least 3 screenshots of actual game play in the instructions (10 points)
- Choose 1 feature of your game that you developed that incorporates code. Create a Google Doc in which you...
    - Explain what the feature added is and explain key features of your code that make it work. Be sure to discuss parameters and returns of functions as well as any class variables that are used. Your response should be between 100 and 200 words. (20 points)
    - Discuss the development process for that feature. Explain how you incrementally achieved your goal and discuss any problems you had along the way as well as solutions to those problems. Your response should be between 100 and 200 words. (20 points)
    - Create a short video (15-30 seconds) demonstrating that feature. You can save your video in Google Drive. Copy the link into your Doc and be sure that you set the sharing permissions on the video so that I can view it. (10 points)
